I'm a freelancer writer specializing in artificial intelligence, cloud computing, data science, and developer technology. Most recently I worked as a reporter for [_Wired_](http://www.wired.com/author/kfinley/), where I covered telecommunications, software development, privacy, technology law, network neutrality, machine learning, open source, hacker culture, startup culture, code literacy and more.

If you'd like to hire me for content creation, ghostwriting, or other writing or editing projects, feel free to email me at klintfinley@gmail.com.
