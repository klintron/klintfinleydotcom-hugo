I'm a writer and editor. Most recently I worked as a reporter for [_Wired_](http://www.wired.com/author/kfinley/), where I covered telecommunications, software development, privacy, technology law, network neutrality, machine learning, open source, hacker culture, startup culture, code literacy and more.

I'm currently taking a break while I think about what I want to do next. You can reach me at klintfinley@gmail.com if you have ideas.

Sometimes I write [fiction](https://klintron.com/fiction/) and [role playing games](https://klintron.com/games/).

Iâ€™m available to speak about any of my beats, or about journalism in general, at independent conferences and other events. See [here](https://klintfinley.com/speaking/) for more info.
