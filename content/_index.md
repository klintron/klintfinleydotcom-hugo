I'm a writer and editor looking for work in content marketing or other fields. Most recently I worked as a reporter for [_Wired_](http://www.wired.com/author/kfinley/), where I covered telecommunications, software development, privacy, technology law, network neutrality, machine learning, open source, hacker culture, startup culture, code literacy and more. Sometimes I write [fiction](https://klintron.com/fiction/) and [role playing games](https://klintron.com/games/).

If you'd like to hire me for freelance or full-time work, feel free to email me at klintfinley@gmail.com.
