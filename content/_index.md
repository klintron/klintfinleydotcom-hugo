I write for [Wired](http://www.wired.com/author/kfinley/), where I report on telecommunications, software development, privacy, technology law, network neutrality, machine learning, open source, hacker culture, startup culture, code literacy and more.

I’m always looking for story ideas. You can contact me at “me at klintfinley dot com.” If it’s sensitive, you can send me an encrypted e-mail. My public GPG key is [here](https://klintfinley.com/contact/).

Sometimes I write [fiction](https://klintron.com/fiction/) and [role playing games](https://klintron.com/games/).

I’m available to speak about any of my beats, or about journalism in general, at independent conferences and other events. See [here](https://klintfinley.com/speaking/) for more info.
