I'm a writer and editor. Most recently I worked as a reporter for [_Wired_](http://www.wired.com/author/kfinley/), where I covered telecommunications, software development, privacy, technology law, network neutrality, machine learning, open source, hacker culture, startup culture, code literacy and more.

If you'd like to hire me for freelance or full-time work, feel free to email me at klintfinley@gmail.com.

Sometimes I write [fiction](https://klintron.com/fiction/) and [role playing games](https://klintron.com/games/).

Iâ€™m available to speak about any of my beats, or about journalism in general, at independent conferences and other events. See [here](https://klintfinley.com/speaking/) for more info.
